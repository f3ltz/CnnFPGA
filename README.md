IEEE 754 Floating-Point Standard Representation

IEEE 754 is a widely used standard for representing floating-point numbers in computers. It defines how real numbers are stored in binary form, ensuring consistency across different systems. The standard mainly defines two formats:

    Single Precision (32-bit)

    Double Precision (64-bit)

For your Verilog module, you're working with Single Precision (32-bit) representation.
IEEE 754 Single Precision Format (32-bit)

A 32-bit floating-point number consists of three main components:
Sign (1 bit)	Exponent (8 bits)	Mantissa / Fraction (23 bits)
Determines if the number is positive (0) or negative (1)	Stores the exponent value in biased form	Stores the fractional part of the number
Breakdown of Components

    Sign Bit (1 bit)

        If 0: The number is positive

        If 1: The number is negative

    Exponent (8 bits)

        Stored in biased format using 127 as the bias

        Actual exponent = Stored exponent - 127

        Example:

            If exponent bits are 10000010 (130 in decimal), then
            Actual exponent = 130 - 127 = 3

    Mantissa / Fraction (23 bits)

        The real fraction is assumed to have an implicit leading 1, i.e.,
        1.XXX... (normalized representation)

        Example:

            If fraction is 10000000000000000000000, then actual value = 1.5 in decimal

Example: Representing 13.25 in IEEE 754 (Single Precision)

    Convert to binary:
    13.25 → 1101.01

    Normalize it to the form 1.xxxx × 2ⁿ:
    1.10101 × 2³

    Determine the components:

        Sign bit: 0 (positive number)

        Exponent: 3 + 127 = 130 → 10000010

        Mantissa: 10101000000000000000000 (excluding the implicit 1.)

    Final IEEE 754 Representation:

    0 10000010 10101000000000000000000

In Hexadecimal, this is: 0x41540000
Why IEEE 754?

    Allows efficient arithmetic operations

    Handles extremely large and small numbers

    Provides a standardized representation for all computing platforms
